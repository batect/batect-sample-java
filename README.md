# international-transfers-service

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/batect/batect-sample-java.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/batect/batect-sample-java)

A sample service with two dependencies (a database and another service) with [batect](https://github.com/batect/batect)-based
build and testing environments.

## Building, testing, running etc.

Run `./batect --list-tasks` to see the available commands and their descriptions, then `./batect <task>` to run `<task>`.

All of this is controlled by [batect.yml](batect.yml), and it shows a number of common patterns you might adopt in your own
application - things like tasks for different kinds of tests, a task to run the application, and a task to start a shell
in your build environment.

## Tests

There are three kinds of tests:

* Unit tests (stored under `src/test`): exactly what it sounds like. This might also include contract tests.

* Integration tests (stored under `src/integrationTest`): tests for individual components (eg. single methods or classes)
  that interact with an external dependency and that require that dependency (or a fake) to be running for the tests to pass. 
  An example of something to test here is interactions with our database.

* Journey tests (stored under `src/journeyTest`): tests that exercise one or more user journeys. Some people might call these
  functional tests or end-to-end tests. These tests require all external dependencies (or appropriate fakes) to be running for the
  tests to pass, and interact with the service as a user / consumer would (using its HTTP interface, for example). As these tests
  only use the external API, these could be written in a different language, but we use Java for everything for simplicity.

## Important notes

As this is just a sample application used to demonstrate how to use batect, the code itself is definitely not production ready.
A number of shortcuts have been taken, including:

* There is no error checking or validation
* There is no logging
* Nothing is configurable (eg. port used for HTTP and database connection string are hard-coded)
* The database schema is hardcoded into the database Docker container (ideally some kind of schema migrations system would be in place)
* There are no consumer-driven contract tests in place
* Many of the unit and integration tests are very simple, and many test cases are missing
* Many things could be more efficient or done in a more maintainable way
* No dependency injection framework, everything is done by hand
